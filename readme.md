# Requester

**Requester** is an application that helps you test APIs.

# Electron project setup

When configuring the application, I first went through the guide on the official electron framework documentation. The official documentation did not show how to integrate the framework with [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), so I found a boilerplate starter [electron forge](https://www.electronforge.io/). Using the starter documentation, I went through the following steps:

1. I created a new project using [this](https://www.electronforge.io/templates/typescript-+-webpack-template) boilerplate.
2. I installed React according to [this](https://www.electronforge.io/guides/framework-integration/react-with-typescript) guide.
